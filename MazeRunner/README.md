# Maze Runner

A console‐based game using graph & BFS algorithm.  
- Represent the maze internally as a graph (adjacency list)  
- Use BFS to compute shortest path from start to goal  
- Allows player movement with W/A/S/D keys  
- At end of game, prints the shortest path

## How to play
Run: `python3 maze_runner.py`  
Follow on-screen instructions.

## Concepts used
- Graph data structure  
- Breadth‐First Search (BFS) algorithm  
- 2D grid representation
